# Simple-To-Do-list
A simple to do list written in Python assisted by chatGPT 3

Trying to learn some basic Python by (almost) solely using  OpenAi's chatGPT 3 
This to-do-list isn't very special. Just trying to figure out how chatGPT responds to certain inputs. 

The goal is to create fully functioning programs, addons, plug-ins etc. using chatGPT 3.
